Feature: The issue hierarchy defines the allowed versions for each issue dependent on the type
  As a team member
  I want to CRUD issues with a reliable target version system
  So that I know what target version an issue can have or will be assigned

  Background:
    Given there is 1 project with:
        | name  | ecookbook |
    And I am working in project "ecookbook"
    And the project uses the following modules:
        | backlogs |
    And there is a role "scrum master"
    And the role "scrum master" may have the following rights:
        | view_master_backlog     |
        | view_taskboards         |
        | update_sprints          |
        | update_stories          |
        | create_impediments      |
        | update_impediments      |
        | update_tasks            |
        | view_wiki_pages         |
        | edit_wiki_pages         |
        | view_issues             |
        | edit_issues             |
        | manage_subtasks         |
        | create_tasks            |
        | add_issues              |
    And there are the following issue status:
        | name        | is_closed  | is_default  |
        | New         | false      | true        |
        | In Progress | false      | false       |
        | Resolved    | false      | false       |
        | Closed      | true       | false       |
        | Rejected    | true       | false       |
    And there is a default issuepriority with:
        | name   | Normal |
    And the backlogs module is initialized
    And the following trackers are configured to track stories:
        | Story |
    And the tracker "Task" is configured to track tasks
    And the project uses the following trackers:
        | Story |
        | Epic  |
        | Task  |
        | Bug   |
    And the tracker "Task" has the default workflow for the role "scrum master"
    And there is 1 user with:
        | login | markus |
        | firstname | Markus |
        | Lastname | Master |
    And the user "markus" is a "scrum master"
    And the project has the following sprints:
        | name       | start_date | effective_date  |
        | Sprint 001 | 2010-01-01        | 2010-01-31      |
        | Sprint 002 | 2010-02-01        | 2010-02-28      |
        | Sprint 003 | 2010-03-01        | 2010-03-31      |
        | Sprint 004 | 2.weeks.ago       | 1.week.from_now |
        | Sprint 005 | 3.weeks.ago       | 2.weeks.from_now|
    And the project has the following stories in the following sprints:
        | subject | sprint     |
        | Story A | Sprint 001 |
        | Story B | Sprint 001 |
        | Story C | Sprint 002 |
    And I am already logged in as "markus"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Creating a task, via the taskboard, as a subtask to a story sets the target version to the story´s version
    Given I am on the taskboard for "Sprint 001"
     When I click to add a new task for story "Story A"
      And I fill in "Task 0815" for "subject"
      And I press "OK"
     Then I should see "Task 0815" as a task to story "Story A"
      And the request on task "Task 0815" is finished
      And the task "Task 0815" should have "Sprint 001" as its target version

      And the request on task "Task1" is finished
      And the request on task "Task2" is finished
      And the request on task "Task3" is finished
     Then there should not be a saving error on task "Task3"
      And the task "Task1" should have "Sprint 001" as its target version
      And the task "Task2" should have "Sprint 001" as its target version
      And the task "Task3" should have "Sprint 001" as its target version
