      And I follow "Backlogs"
     Then I should be on the master backlog

  Scenario: View the product backlog

      And I request the server_variables resource
     Then the request should complete successfully

  Scenario: View the product backlog without any stories
    Given there are no stories in the project
     When I go to the master backlog
     Then the request should complete successfully
