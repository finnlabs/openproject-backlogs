  As a user
  I want to edit the tracker and the status of a story
  In consideration of existing workflows
  So that I can not make changes that are not permitted by the system

  Background:

        | name  | ecookbook |

    And the following trackers are configured to track stories:
        | Story |

    And the project uses the following trackers:
        | Story |
        | Bug   |
        | Task  |
    And there is 1 user with:
        | login | romano |
    And there is a role "manager"
