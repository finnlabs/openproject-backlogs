Feature: Edit story on backlogs view
  As a team member
  I want to manage story details and story priority on the scrum backlogs view
  So that I do not loose context while filling in details

  Background:
    Given there is 1 project with:
        | name  | ecookbook |
    And I am working in project "ecookbook"
    And the project uses the following modules:
        | backlogs |
    And the following trackers are configured to track stories:
        | Story |
        | Epic  |
        | Bug   |
    And the tracker "Task" is configured to track tasks
    And the project uses the following trackers:
        | Story |
        | Bug   |
        | Task  |
    And there is 1 user with:
        | login | mathias |
    And there is a role "team member"
    And the role "team member" may have the following rights:
        | view_master_backlog   |
        | create_stories        |
        | update_stories        |
        | view_issues           |
        | edit_issues           |
        | manage_subtasks       |
    And the user "mathias" is a "team member"
    And the project has the following sprints:
        | name       | start_date | effective_date |
        | Sprint 001 | 2010-01-01        | 2010-01-31     |
        | Sprint 002 | 2010-02-01        | 2010-02-28     |
        | Sprint 003 | 2010-03-01        | 2010-03-31     |
        | Sprint 004 | 2010-03-01        | 2010-03-31     |
    And the project has the following owner backlogs:
        | Product Backlog |
        | Wishlist        |
    And there are the following issue status:
        | name        | is_closed  | is_default  |
        | New         | false      | true        |
        | In Progress | false      | false       |
        | Resolved    | false      | false       |
        | Closed      | true       | false       |
        | Rejected    | true       | false       |
    And the tracker "Story" has the default workflow for the role "team member"
    And there is a default issuepriority with:
        | name   | Normal |
    And the project has the following stories in the following owner backlogs:
        | subject | backlog         |
        | Story 1 | Product Backlog |
        | Story 2 | Product Backlog |
        | Story 3 | Product Backlog |
        | Story 4 | Product Backlog |
    And the project has the following stories in the following sprints:
        | subject | sprint     | story_points |
        | Story A | Sprint 001 | 10           |
        | Story B | Sprint 001 | 20           |
