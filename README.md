OpenProject Backlogs Plugin
===========================

This Plugin adds features, that enable agile teams to work efficiently with
OpenProject in Scrum projects.

Find a more detailed description on [OpenProject.org](https://www.openproject.org/projects/openproject/wiki/Agile_teams).


Requirements
------------

The OpenProject Backlogs plug-in requires the [OpenProject Core](https://github.com/opf/openproject/) in
version greater or equal to *3.0.0pre30*.

Tests for this plugin require `pdf-inspector`, so just add the following line to
OpenProject's `Gemfile.plugin`:

`gem "pdf-inspector", "~>1.0.0", :group => :test`


Installation
------------

OpenProject Backlogs depends on OpenProject Plugins. Thus, if you haven't done
it already, add the following line to the `Gemfile.plugins` to your OpenProject installation:

`gem "openproject-plugins", git: "https://github.com/opf/openproject-plugins.git"`

For OpenProject Backlogs itself you need to add the following line to the
`Gemfile.plugins` of OpenProject:

`gem "openproject-backlogs", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-backlogs.git"`

Afterwards, run:

`bundle install`

This plugin contains migrations. To migrate the database, run:

`rake db:migrate`


Deinstallation
--------------

Remove the line

`gem "openproject-backlogs", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-backlogs.git"`

from the file `Gemfile.plugins` and run:

`bundle install`

Please not that this leaves plugin data in the database. Currently, we do not
support full uninstall of the plugin.
